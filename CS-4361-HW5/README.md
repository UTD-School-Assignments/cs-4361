=====================
Dragon Rounded Curves
=====================

This program generates and displays the Dragon Curve fractal with rounded corners to the specified recursion level. 

Files:
- DragonCurves.java: The main program file that includes the logic for fractal generation and display.
- CvDragonCurves.class: The compiled class file for CvDragonCurves.
- CvDragonCurves.java: The Java file that handles the drawing operations.
- dragon.txt: Contains the initial parameters and rules for fractal generation.
- Input.class: Compiled helper class used for reading the dragon.txt file.
- Input.java: Helper class that reads the fractal parameters and rules from dragon.txt.
- 8thGenCurve.png: An image showing the output of the fractal at the 8th generation.

Usage:
To run the program, compile the Java files and execute DragonCurves with dragon.txt as the argument. The fractal will be drawn in a window where the level can be adjusted with mouse clicks.

====================
Letter A Effects 
====================

This Java program demonstrates various text effects using the letter 'A'. The effects include transparency, gradients, and textures to showcase different visual styling within a graphical user interface.

Files:
- LetterA.java: The main program file responsible for creating the GUI and invoking the text effects.
- CvTextEffects.java: Contains the drawing logic to apply the various effects to the letter 'A'.
- LetterA.class, LetterA$1.class: Compiled bytecode files for the LetterA program.
- texture.png: Texture image used for demonstrating texture effects on the letter 'A'.
- A_Output.png: An output image showing the letter 'A' with applied effects.

Usage:
Compile the Java files and run LetterA to see the graphical effects applied to the letter 'A' in a window.

====================
Fractal Tree (BONUS)
====================

This program draws a fractal tree using recursive algorithms and graphical transformations. The tree is represented as a series of branching lines to simulate natural growth patterns.

Files:
- TreeBonus.java: The main class that sets up the GUI and initiates the tree drawing process.
- TreeBonus.class: The compiled class file for TreeBonus.
- FractalTree.png: An image that shows the output of the fractal tree.

Usage:
Compile TreeBonus.java and run the program to display the fractal tree. The program will render the tree in a new window.
